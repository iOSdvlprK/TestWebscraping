# TestWebscraping



A curiosity about.. how URLSession or Alamofire is used in the command line environment.

Plus SwiftSoup in order to parse html as well.



## How to start a command line project

First create and enter a directory:

> $ mkdir `TestWebscraping`
>
> $ cd `TestWebscraping`

Run the swift package command:

> $ swift package init --type executable

Build and run commands are:

> $ swift build
>
> $ swift run

And you can update the third party modules under **Swift Package Manager** like this:

> $ swift package update
